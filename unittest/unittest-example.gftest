# This file consists of some example unittests
# Tests are separated by blank lines
# Comment lines start with "#" or "--"

# The recommendation is to put unittest files 
# in the directory 'src/(language)/unittest'
# and use the file suffix '.gftest'

# Basic usage: a sentence and its translation
LangEng: I sleep in the house
LangSwe: jag sover i huset

# Comparing a sentence and a parse tree
LangEng: the house is big
Lang: PhrUtt NoPConj (UttS (UseCl (TTAnt TPres ASimul) PPos (PredVP (DetCN (DetQuant DefArt NumSg) (UseN house_N)) (UseComp (CompAP (PositA big_A)))))) NoVoc

-- Several translations of a sentence
LangEng: I sleep in the house
LangSwe: jag sover i huset
LangGer: ich schlafe im Haus

-- Ambiguous sentences (the fish can be singular or plural)
-- The test is correct if some translations match
-- (i.e., if the set of parse trees overlap)
LangEng: the cat eats the fish
LangSwe: katten Ã¤ter fisken

# If we only specify one sentence, the script only checks if it's possible to parse
LangEng: the cat in Paris sleeps

# This test should fail, because they are not translations of each other
LangEng: the house is big
LangSwe: jag sover i huset

# This test should fail, because the tree does not have this linearisation
LangEng: the house is small
Lang: PhrUtt NoPConj (UttS (UseCl (TTAnt TPres ASimul) PPos (PredVP (DetCN (DetQuant DefArt NumSg) (UseN house_N)) (UseComp (CompAP (PositA big_A)))))) NoVoc


# And finally some GF parsing errors

# This sentence cannot be parsed:
LangEng: this is not parseable
LangSwe: jag sover i huset

# This sentence is not complete:
LangEng: I sleep in
LangSwe: jag sover i huset

# This is not an abstract syntax tree:
Lang: THIS IS NOT A TREE
LangSwe: jag sover i huset
