ResourceDemo is a good place to start investigating linguistic structures in the GF Resource Grammar Library.

It is a slightly simplified version of the full RGL, aimed for reducing ambiguity and supporting fast parsing.
It also supports the display of dependency trees using the UD (Universal Dependencies) schema.
(However, for most languages, some dummy 'dep' labels are still in use in the UD trees.)
