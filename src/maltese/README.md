## Implementation information

### Verb morphology

Initial implementation included all enclitic pronouns within verb inflection table, some ~1000 forms. This became uncompilable.
Re-implemetation stores 3 verb stems which are then combined with pronouns using bind.
Choosing the right stem in each case is tricky, and it's unconfirmed whether 3 stems is enough to cover all cases.
