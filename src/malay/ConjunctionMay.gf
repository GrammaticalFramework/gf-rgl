    {- Conjunction for category X needs four things:
       lincat [X]
       lin BaseX
       lin ConsX
       lin ConjX

    For example, if X is defined as

      lincat X   = {s     : Number => Str ;   g : Gender} ;

    then [X] will split its s field into two, and retain its other fields as is:

      lincat [X] = {s1,s2 : Number => Str ;   g : Gender} ;

    Let us look at a simple case: Adv is of type {s : Str}
    Then [Adv] is {s1,s2 : Str}.
    BaseAdv, ConsAdv and ConjAdv can all use functions defined in prelude/Coordination:

      BaseAdv = twoSS ;
      ConsAdv = consrSS comma ;
      ConjAdv = conjunctSS ;

    --}


-- Adverb and other simple {s : Str} types.
lincat
  [Adv],[AdV],[IAdv] = {s1,s2 : Str} ;

lin
  BaseAdv, BaseAdV, BaseIAdv = twoSS ;
  ConsAdv, ConsAdV, ConsIAdv = consrSS comma ;
  ConjAdv, ConjAdV, ConjIAdv = conjunctDistrSS ;

lincat

lin
