This is a compilable, almost complete, but not yet perfect implementation of the GF resource grammar for Chinese.

The Synopsis test set has the following statistics:

  GOOD 295  68%
  SOSO  66  15%
  BAD   76  17%

More details:

  eng_chi2.txt     -- the test set with annotations
  chinese-log.txt  -- a log of the grammar writing process

There is also a Pinyin version of the grammar, in the subdirectory ./pinyin/.

The grammar is not yet a part of the "official" demos and documentation. But you can find alpha versions in
