**Note**: You can browse using the syntax editor
[directly on the web http://cloud.grammaticalframework.org/syntax-editor/editor.html].

All of the following assume that
``GF_LIB_PATH`` points to the directory ``GF/lib`` with compiled libraries.

To try out inflection paradigms:
```
  > i -retain alltenses/ParadigmsGer.gfo
  > cc mkN "Farbe"
```
To try out overloaded syntax, test lexicon, and inflection paradigms:
```
  > i -retain alltenses/TryGer.gfo
  > cc mkCl (mkNP this_Quant (mkN "Farbe")) (mkA "dunkel")
```
