<h1> Adjective: Adjectives and Adjectival Phrases</h1>

<pre>
  abstract Adjective = Cat ** {
  
    fun
</pre>

The principal ways of forming an adjectival phrase are
positive, comparative, relational, reflexive-relational, and
elliptic-relational.
<pre>
      PositA  : A  -> AP ;        -- warm
      ComparA : A  -> NP -> AP ;  -- warmer than I
      ComplA2 : A2 -> NP -> AP ;  -- married to her
      ReflA2  : A2 -> AP ;        -- married to itself
      UseA2   : A2 -> AP ;        -- married
      UseComparA : A  -> AP ;     -- warmer
      CAdvAP  : CAdv -> AP -> NP -> AP ; -- as cool as John
</pre>

The superlative use is covered in <tt>Ord</tt>.
<pre>
      AdjOrd  : Ord -> AP ;       -- warmest
</pre>

Sentence and question complements defined for all adjectival
phrases, although the semantics is only clear for some adjectives.
<pre>
      SentAP  : AP -> SC -> AP ;  -- good that she is here
</pre>

An adjectival phrase can be modified by an <b>adadjective</b>, such as <i>very</i>.
<pre>
      AdAP    : AdA -> AP -> AP ; -- very warm
</pre>

It can also be postmodified by an adverb, typically a prepositional phrase.
<pre>
      AdvAP   : AP -> Adv -> AP ; -- warm by nature
</pre>

The formation of adverbs from adjectives (e.g. <i>quickly</i>) is covered
in [Adverb Adverb.html]; the same concerns adadjectives (e.g. <i>extremely</i>).
