<h1> Sentence: Sentences, Clauses, and Imperatives</h1>

<pre>
  abstract Sentence = Cat ** {
</pre>

<h2> Clauses</h2>
The <tt>NP VP</tt> predication rule form a clause whose linearization
gives a table of all tense variants, positive and negative.
Clauses are converted to <tt>S</tt> (with fixed tense) with the
<tt>UseCl</tt> function below.
<pre>
    data
      PredVP    : NP -> VP -> Cl ;         -- John walks
</pre>

Using an embedded sentence as a subject is treated separately.
This can be overgenerating. E.g. <i>whether you go</i> as subject
is only meaningful for some verb phrases.
<pre>
      PredSCVP  : SC -> VP -> Cl ;         -- that she goes is good
</pre>

<h2> Clauses missing object noun phrases</h2>
This category is a variant of the 'slash category' <tt>S/NP</tt> of
GPSG and categorial grammars, which in turn replaces
movement transformations in the formation of questions
and relative clauses. Except <tt>SlashV2</tt>, the construction 
rules can be seen as special cases of function composition, in
the style of CCG.
<b>Note</b> the set is not complete and lacks e.g. verbs with more than 2 places.
<pre>
      SlashVP   : NP -> VPSlash -> ClSlash ;      -- (whom) he sees
      AdvSlash  : ClSlash -> Adv -> ClSlash ;     -- (whom) he sees today
      SlashPrep : Cl -> Prep -> ClSlash ;         -- (with whom) he walks 
      SlashVS   : NP -> VS -> SSlash -> ClSlash ; -- (whom) she says that he loves
</pre>

<h2> Imperatives</h2>
An imperative is straightforwardly formed from a verb phrase.
It has variation over positive and negative, singular and plural.
To fix these parameters, see [Phrase Phrase.html].
<pre>
      ImpVP     : VP -> Imp ;              -- love yourselves
</pre>

<h2> Embedded sentences</h2>
Sentences, questions, and infinitival phrases can be used as
subjects and (adverbial) complements.
<pre>
      EmbedS    : S  -> SC ;               -- that she goes
      EmbedQS   : QS -> SC ;               -- who goes
      EmbedVP   : VP -> SC ;               -- to go
</pre>

<h2> Sentences</h2>
These are the 2 x 4 x 4 = 16 forms generated by different
combinations of tense, polarity, and
anteriority, which are defined in [``Common`` Common.html].
<pre>
    fun
      UseCl    : Temp -> Pol -> Cl  -> S ;
      UseQCl   : Temp -> Pol -> QCl -> QS ;
      UseRCl   : Temp -> Pol -> RCl -> RS ;
      UseSlash : Temp -> Pol -> ClSlash -> SSlash ;
</pre>

An adverb can be added to the beginning of a sentence, either with comma (<i>externally</i>)
or without:
<pre>
      AdvS     : Adv -> S  -> S ;            -- then I will go home
      ExtAdvS  : Adv -> S  -> S ;            -- next week, I will go home
</pre>

This covers subjunctive clauses, but they can also be added to the end.
<pre>
      SSubjS   : S -> Subj -> S -> S ;       -- I go home if she comes
</pre>

A sentence can be modified by a relative clause referring to its contents.
<pre>
      RelS     : S -> RS -> S ;              -- she sleeps, which is good
</pre>

-- A sentence can also be post-modified by a subjunct sentence.
--    ModSubjS : S -> Subj -> S -> S ;       -- she sleeps, because she is old 
-- cf. Adverb.SubjS
<pre>
  }
</pre>
