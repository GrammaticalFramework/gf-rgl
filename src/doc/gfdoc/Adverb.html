<h1> Adverb: Adverbs and Adverbial Phrases</h1>

<pre>
  abstract Adverb = Cat ** {
  
    fun
</pre>

The two main ways of forming adverbs are from adjectives and by
prepositions from noun phrases.
<pre>
      PositAdvAdj : A -> Adv ;                 -- warmly
      PrepNP      : Prep -> NP -> Adv ;        -- in the house
</pre>

Comparative adverbs have a noun phrase or a sentence as object of
comparison.
<pre>
      ComparAdvAdj  : CAdv -> A -> NP -> Adv ; -- more warmly than John
      ComparAdvAdjS : CAdv -> A -> S  -> Adv ; -- more warmly than he runs
</pre>

Adverbs can be modified by 'adadjectives', just like adjectives.
<pre>
      AdAdv  : AdA -> Adv -> Adv ;             -- very quickly
</pre>

Like adverbs, adadjectives can be produced by adjectives.
<pre>
      PositAdAAdj : A -> AdA ;                 -- extremely
</pre>

Subordinate clauses can function as adverbs.
<pre>
      SubjS  : Subj -> S -> Adv ;              -- when she sleeps
</pre>

Comparison adverbs also work as numeral adverbs.
<pre>
      AdnCAdv : CAdv -> AdN ;                  -- less (than five)
  
  }
</pre>
