This document contains the most important parts of the GF Resource Grammar API,
as needed by a GF application programmer.
It has been machine-generated from the source files; there are links
to the relevant source files, which give more information. Some of the files have
not yet been prepared so that the machine generated documentation has the nicest
possible format.

The main contents are:
- [Chapter 1 #toc2]: categories, with links to the functions for
constructing trees in them.
- [Chapter 2 #toc5]: syntactic construction functions, with cross-links and
examples. 
- [Chapter 3 #toc84]: morphological paradigms.
- [Chapter 4 #toc116]: additional libraries.
- [Chapter 5 #toc122]: how to "browse" the library by 
loading the grammars into the ``gf`` command editor.
- [Chapter 6 #toc123]: a brief example of how application grammars can
use the resource modules. 
- [Detailed table of contents #toc124].
