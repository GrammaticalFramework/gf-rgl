=Introduction=

The GF Resource Grammar Library is the standard library for Grammatical Framework.
It covers the morphology and basic syntax of currently #LANGUAGE_COUNT languages:
#LANGUAGES

This document contains the most important parts of the GF Resource Grammar API,
as needed by a GF application programmer.
It has been machine-generated from the source files; there are links
to the relevant source files, which give more information. Some of the files have
not yet been prepared so that the machine generated documentation has the nicest
possible format.

% These hardcoded TOC links (chapter 4 onwards) need to be updated as new languages are added.

The main contents are:
- [Chapter 1 #toc2]: categories, with links to the functions for constructing trees in them.
- [Chapter 2 #toc5]: syntactic construction functions, with cross-links and examples.
- [Chapter 3 #toc85]: morphological (lexical) paradigms.
- [Chapter 4 #toc121]: additional libraries.
- [Chapter 5 #toc127]: how to "browse" the library by loading the grammars into the ``gf`` command editor.
- [Chapter 6 #toc128]: a brief example of how application grammars can use the resource modules.
- [Detailed table of contents #toc129].


The [RGL Browser http://www.grammaticalframework.org/~john/rgl-browser/] tool allows you to interactively browse through
the library, view all functions in a module's scope, and quickly jump to their definitions.
