<h1> Conjunction: Coordination</h1>

Coordination is defined for many different categories; here is
a sample. The rules apply to <b>lists</b> of two or more elements,
and define two general patterns: 
- ordinary conjunction: X,...X and X
- distributed conjunction: both X,...,X and X
<p>
<p>
<tt>VP</tt> conjunctions are not covered here, because their applicability
depends on language. Some special cases are defined in 
[``Extra`` ../abstract/Extra.gf].
<pre>
  abstract Conjunction = Cat ** {
</pre>

<h2> Rules</h2>
<pre>
    fun
      ConjS    : Conj -> [S] -> S ;       -- "he walks and she runs"
      ConjRS   : Conj -> [RS] -> RS ;     -- "who walks and whose mother runs"
      ConjAP   : Conj -> [AP] -> AP ;     -- "cold and warm"
      ConjNP   : Conj -> [NP] -> NP ;     -- "she or we"
      ConjAdv  : Conj -> [Adv] -> Adv ;   -- "here or there"
      ConjIAdv : Conj -> [IAdv] -> IAdv ; -- "where and with whom"
      ConjCN   : Conj -> [CN] -> CN ;     -- "man and woman"
</pre>

<h2> Categories</h2>
These categories are only used in this module.
<pre>
    cat
      [S]{2} ; 
      [RS]{2} ; 
      [Adv]{2} ; 
      [NP]{2} ; 
      [AP]{2} ;
      [IAdv]{2} ;
      [CN] {2} ;
</pre>

<h2> List constructors</h2>
The list constructors are derived from the list notation and therefore
not given explicitly. But here are their type signatures:
<pre>
    --  BaseC : C -> C   -> [C] ;  -- for C = S, AP, NP, Adv
    --  ConsC : C -> [C] -> [C] ;
  }
</pre>
