<h1> Relative clauses and pronouns</h1>

<pre>
  abstract Relative = Cat ** {
  
    fun
</pre>

The simplest way to form a relative clause is from a clause by
a pronoun similar to <i>such that</i>.
<pre>
      RelCl    : Cl -> RCl ;            -- such that John loves her
</pre>

The more proper ways are from a verb phrase 
(formed in [``Verb`` Verb.html]) or a sentence 
with a missing noun phrase (formed in [``Sentence`` Sentence.html]).
<pre>
      RelVP    : RP -> VP -> RCl ;      -- who loves John
      RelSlash : RP -> ClSlash -> RCl ; -- whom John loves
</pre>

Relative pronouns are formed from an 'identity element' by prefixing
or suffixing (depending on language) prepositional phrases or genitives.
<pre>
      IdRP  : RP ;                      -- which
      FunRP : Prep -> NP -> RP -> RP ;  -- the mother of whom
  
  }
</pre>
