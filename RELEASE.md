# RGL releases

The RGL does not use semantic versioning.
Releases are instead made periodically, as snapshots of the current state of the library.
Releases are Git tagged `YYYYMMDD`, and for each release a binary package (as `.gfo` files) is made available as a GitHub release.

## Creating a new release

1. Run the "Create release" workflow through the GitHub actions interface
   (instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow)).
